food B-positive
wise O
#PUNCT# O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant O
isn't O
a O
fancy O
place O
#PUNCT# O

– O
tucked O
away O
over O
by O
the O
beverly O
center O
#PUNCT# O

my O
mouth O
felt O
very O
dry O
afterwards O
and O
i O
had O
that O
signature O
#PUNCT# O
msg O
#PUNCT# O
taste O
lingering O
in O
my O
throat O
after O
i O
left O
the O
restaurant O
#PUNCT# O

it's O
a O
tiny O
place O
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8p O
m O
on O
a O
weekend O
#PUNCT# O
thurs O
#PUNCT# O
sun O
#PUNCT# O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
#PUNCT# O

the O

the O

reminds O
me O

my O
recent O

#PUNCT# O

we O
all O
agreed O
that O
mare O

one O
of O
the O

#PUNCT# O

believe O
it O
baby O

we O
have O
since O

also O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
#PUNCT# O
sampling O
more O
small O

a O
variety O
of O
the O

#PUNCT# O

it O
was O
so O
much O
though O
that O
i O
could O
barely O
finish O
but O
i O
did O
#PUNCT# O
since O
it O
was O
delicious O
#PUNCT# O

the O

was O
very O
nice O

courteous O
and O
obviously O
chinese O
#PUNCT# O

this O
was O
#PUNCT# O
from O
start O
to O
finish O
#PUNCT# O
a O
mind-bogglingly O
uncomfortable O
experience O
#PUNCT# O

i O
went O
here O
with O
a O
friend O
on O
a O
whim O
#PUNCT# O
we O
went O
someplace O
else O
first O
and O
couldn't O
get O
a O
table O
#PUNCT# O

we O
concluded O
with O
tiramisu O
chocolate O

#PUNCT# O
both O
were O
delicious O
#PUNCT# O

not O
much O

this O

i O
wish O
this O

a O

#PUNCT# O

we O
did O
arrive O

#PUNCT# O

i O
have O

to O
be O
back O
very O
soon O
#PUNCT# O

yes O
#PUNCT# O
i O
ate O
the O

#PUNCT# O

i O
have O
